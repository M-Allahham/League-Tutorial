This repository contains code from two tutorials I've posted on unknowncheats.me. This is purely educational.

You can find the tutorials here:

The Injector has code for syscalls that was shamelessly taken from KebsCS' LeagueInternal repository

It is also a fantastic resource that you should take a look at! You can find it here: https://github.com/KebsCS/League-DirectX11-Internal/tree/main/LeagueDx11Internal

Everything was written in Visual Studio 2019. Compile on x86 Release, update offsets and modify line 51 of main.cpp to your DLL's path in the injector if you want to use it.

# ExampleDLL:
This is a super basic DLL example, nothing special about it.


# Injector:
A DLL injector intended to inject into League of Legends.exe. Make sure that you change line 51 in main.cpp to your DLL's path. 


# InternalTutorial:
A basic orbwalker for part 2 of my tutorial "series"


# MemoryPractice:
An autohealer from part 1 of my tutorial "series"
